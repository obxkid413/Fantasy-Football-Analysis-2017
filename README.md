# Fantasy-Football-Analysis-2017

This program grabs 2017 fantasy football stats from ESPN.com, cleans the data, aggregates a few stats, and graphs 
an interactive plot in Bokeh.  I would welcome any modifications or ideas, especially about the Bokeh figure.  I could not
quite figure out the plot tools and how to keep all the common tools like wheel_zoom and pan.  Thanks for any suggestions!
